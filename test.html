 <p id="summary">Red foxes mate in winter. After a gestation period of seven or eight weeks, the female (vixen) gives birth to 1â€“10 or more (5 is average) young (kits, cubs, or pups). Birth takes place in a den, which is commonly a burrow abandoned by another animal. It is often enlarged by the parent foxes. The cubs remain in the den for about five weeks and are cared for by both parents throughout the summer. The young disperse in the fall once they are fully grown and independent.</p>
